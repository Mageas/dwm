**Welcome to my dwm config!**

❤ Thanks to [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/) to make wonderful programs. ❤️

### **Helpers**

I have made scripts to automate the process of creating/applying patches. Scripts can be found in my [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/Mageas/dotfiles).

How to use helpers scripts:
- **[suckupdate](https://gitea.heartnerds.org/Mageas/sysfiles/src/branch/main/scripts/usr/local/bin/suckupdate)** Build the suckless repository with your patches.
- **[suckload](https://gitea.heartnerds.org/Mageas/sysfiles/src/branch/main/scripts/usr/local/bin/suckload)** Load your patches in separate git branches.
- **[suckdiff](https://gitea.heartnerds.org/Mageas/sysfiles/src/branch/main/scripts/usr/local/bin/suckdiff)** Save your changes in the `patches` directory (You can add a header in `patches/headers`).
- **[suckclean](https://gitea.heartnerds.org/Mageas/sysfiles/src/branch/main/scripts/usr/local/bin/suckclean)** Clean the suckless repository.
